# Student Performance Analysis & Prediction
This project aims to analyze and predict student performance using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various student-related features, we can predict their performance and identify factors that influence their academic success. The project uses multiple algorithms to build prediction models and derives insights to help improve student outcomes.

## Overview
The project explores a dataset containing student academic performance information and other relevant variables like attendance, study time, etc. The goal is to predict the student's final grade and provide insights based on data analysis.

# Key Features:
#### Data Preprocessing: Cleansing and preparation of raw data.
#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distribution and key relationships between variables.
#### Feature Selection: Identifying the most important features for performance prediction.
#### Machine Learning Models: Implementing multiple models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) to predict student performance.
#### Model Evaluation: Comparing models based on performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.


# Dataset
The dataset contains various features that impact a student's performance, such as:

#### Demographic information (age, gender, etc.)
#### Academic records (previous grades, study time)
#### Attendance and participation metrics
#### Social and environmental factors (family background, support systems)

# Models Used
#### The project utilizes the following machine learning algorithms:

#### Linear Regression
#### Decision Tree
#### Random Forest
#### Support Vector Machines (SVM)
#### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
#### The models are trained and evaluated to identify which one performs best in predicting student outcomes.

# Results and Evaluation
#### The models are compared using evaluation metrics such as:

#### Accuracy
#### Precision
#### Recall
#### F1-Score
#### We also perform cross-validation to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
